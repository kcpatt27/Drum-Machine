# Drum Machine Project from freeCodeCamp

- Project for the [Front-End Libraries Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/)
  
- Created a drum machine from scratch using React and Vite
- Used CSS to make it look similar to the [Ableton Push 2](https://www.ableton.com/en/push/) controller
